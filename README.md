# Gantry 5 'Edit this Page' Particle for Grav

Particles are small, modular blocks with preset scripting that enable you to add elements to your Grav Gantry 5 pages.

## Installing a Particle

Upload `edit_page_with_git.html.twig` and `edit_page_with_git.yaml` files to your `/user/themes/THEME_DIR/custom/particles` directory. For example, to install in the default Grav Gantry 5 theme Hydrogen copy the particle files to `user/themes/g5_hydrogen/custom/particles`. If the `custom` folder does not exist create it.
